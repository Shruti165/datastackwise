Key Points:
Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, SQL Server):

Best for handling transactional data (ACID transactions) in banking applications.
Provide strong scalability (vertical) and high performance.
Strong in compliance and regulatory requirements.
NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB):

Suitable for high-volume, low-latency applications.
Scalability (horizontal) and flexibility in data modeling (document, key-value, etc.).
High availability but not typically ACID compliant.
Good for applications dealing with large-scale data, such as market data or trading logs.
In-Memory Databases (e.g., Redis):

Excellent for real-time applications that need ultra-low latency and high throughput (e.g., trading platforms).
Data encryption and high availability can be configured, though used for temporary storage.
Distributed Databases (e.g., CockroachDB, Cassandra, TiDB):

Built to handle global applications, ensuring high availability and data consistency across regions.
Supports large-scale transactional and analytical applications, critical for banking systems.
Cloud Databases (e.g., Google BigQuery, Snowflake):

Ideal for analytical workloads, business intelligence, and data warehousing.
Designed for real-time data processing and analytics at scale.
Time-Series Databases (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB):

Perfect for applications handling continuous time-series data (e.g., stock prices, trading data, IoT financial data).
High scalability and supports complex time-based queries.
Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j):

Useful for applications requiring complex relationships (e.g., fraud detection, risk management).
High scalability with a focus on graph-based queries.
NewSQL Databases (e.g., TiDB, CockroachDB):

Combine the benefits of relational databases (ACID compliance, SQL queries) with the scalability of NoSQL.
Conclusion:
For real-time trading and high-frequency financial transactions, Redis, Cassandra, and CockroachDB are well-suited due to their high availability, low latency, and horizontal scalability.
For regulatory compliance and transaction-heavy applications, Oracle DB, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL are ideal.
For large-scale analytics and business intelligence, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and TimescaleDB are recommended.
This database matching will help in selecting the most appropriate database based on the specific needs of your banking and financial applications.
